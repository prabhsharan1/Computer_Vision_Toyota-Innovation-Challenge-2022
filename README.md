[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This open-source project focuses on utilizing computer vision techniques for object detection and tracking in real-time video streams. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models, particularly YOLOv5, to detect and track objects in live video feeds from webcams or recorded videos.

## Key Features

- **Real-time object detection**: Detects various objects in live video streams with high accuracy and speed.
- **Object tracking**: Tracks the detected objects across frames to maintain their positions and trajectories.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different object detection tasks, such as people tracking, vehicle detection, or custom object recognition.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, making it accessible and easy to experiment with.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual feedback by drawing bounding boxes around detected objects and displaying the video stream.

## Use Cases

- Surveillance systems: Enhance security by monitoring and tracking objects of interest in real-time.
- Robotics: Enable robots to identify and follow objects or obstacles.
- Autonomous vehicles: Aid in detecting and tracking other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs.
- Research and experimentation: A versatile tool for computer vision researchers and enthusiasts.
